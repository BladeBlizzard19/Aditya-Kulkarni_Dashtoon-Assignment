# Aditya-Kulkarni_Dashtoon-Assignment
This repository includes the .ipynb file of the assessment assigned for the Generative AI role at Dashtoon.

# Objective
The objective of this assignment is to build an adaptive deep-learning model for artistic style transfer. Artistic style transfer is a method that uses neural networks to merge the content of one image with the artistic style of another. It creates a new image combining the content of one picture with the visual appearance of another, resulting in a unique stylized artwork. 

# Usage Guidelines
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook "Aditya Kulkarni_Dashtoon.ipynb" file.
2. Import all the necessary dependencies listed in the first cell of the notebook.
3. Load your desired images by replacing the file path in the 6th cell
4. Appropriate comments are mentioned at each cell to assist you in running the code.
